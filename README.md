# ASP.NET Core RazorPages Project
## This project is made for practining development of an ASP.NET Core Application.
In the project I use .NET5.0 to build an e-commerce application that can be deployed in the server in real life.
Also the project currently is in development phase, but gradually it will be completed.
In my opinion the most important of the project is its architecture. I tried to implement the whole project with Onion Architecture.
Technologies that I used in this project:
- ASP.NET Core 5.0
- Entity Framework Core 
- SQLServer
- jQuery
